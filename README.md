# CMPM121_assignment1

My scene is about a bunch of default 3DObjects observing an invasion of assets from the Unity Store that threaten their basic environment. While I initially wanted to have the default 3DObjects use a default texture, that would result in a lower grade, so I instead settled on giving them simple textures. I don't really think anything inspired me, I just thought of the question "Hey, what if the 3DObjects were native to this environment and they were being invaded by unity store assets?". After a small bit I noticed that a lot of the assets I chose had a "snow" theme, so I decided to roll with it and have the ground be a snowy texture. The rest of the objects were just pieces of furniture that had a somewhat realistic look to them. I like to feel that the capsule is the main character due to its more complex shape, which is why I put it at the front.
